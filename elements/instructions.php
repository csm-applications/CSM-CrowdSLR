    <p class="lead">Your task is to read the title and abstract of a scientific article and identify if 
        it meets two inclusion criteria to decide its classification as included or excluded.</p>

        <p class="lead">The Inclusion and Exclusion criteria are:</p>

        <p class="lead"><b>IC1</b> - Does the article focus on aligning Software Engineering education with industrial needs?</p> 

        <p class="lead"><b>IC2</b> - Is the article based on empirical data and not just the opinion of the authors?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="lead">
        The answer to each selection criterion is binary: either Yes (value = 1) or No (value = 0). Only studies which received ``1'' for all the above criteria are included.
        Articles are only included if they clearly meet both inclusion criteria. For example, we are interested in studies focusing on how to align SE education with Industry needs, then studies in other domains and with no empirical data are excluded because they are outside the group of interest.
    </p>
    <p class="lead"><b>Attention: Your decision must be made using the titles and abstracts of the articles; those that are clearly relevant can be included.</b></p>


    <p class="lead">The task will be based on the following format: </p>
